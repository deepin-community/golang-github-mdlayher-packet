Description: Go library for Linux packet sockets (AF_PACKET)
 github.com/mdlayer/packet is a successor to github.com/mdlayher/raw,
 but exclusively focused on Linux and AF_PACKET sockets. The APIs are
 nearly identical, but with a few changes which take into account some
 of the lessons learned while working on raw.
